# About

Three x plus one displays a graph of the collatz conjecture. 

The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3x + 1 conjecture or the hailstone sequence, is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. 
It was first proposed by German mathematician Lothar Collatz in 1937.

The conjecture is quite simple to understand but has proven to be incredibly elusive to prove or disprove. It is defined as follows:

Start with any positive integer x. If x is even, divide it by 2 to get x/2. If x is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 3x + 1. Now take the result and repeat the process, generating a sequence of numbers. The conjecture posits that no matter which positive integer you start with, this sequence will always eventually reach the number 1.

The Collatz Conjecture suggests that if you keep applying the process to the resulting numbers in the sequence, you will eventually reach the cycle: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, and the sequence will continue to loop through this cycle indefinitely. However, despite extensive testing and analysis, a formal proof of the conjecture for all positive integers x remains an open problem in mathematics.

The x-Axis shows the amount of steps to get to the number 1.
The y-Axis displays the number x.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
